### Hi, I'm David! üëã

I'm a software engineer with a background in chemical engineering and aerosol chemisty and physics. I'm currently the CEO of QuantAQ - we build low-cost, professional-grade air quality sensors to supplement existing regulatory monitoring networks.

## `whoami`

- I'm originally from the Bay Area (Napa, CA) and currently reside in Cambridge, MA
- I completed undergrad degrees in Chemical Physics (Hendrix College, AR) and Chemical Engineering (WashU, MO), and a PhD in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (MIT, MA)
- I love baseball (Go Giants!)


## üè° Location

I currently reside in Cambridge, MA and can often be found in one of the many coffee shops around (Broadsheet and Gracenote are favorites).

Previously, I've lived in:

- Napa, CA
- Conway, AR
- Thousand Oaks, CA
- St. Louis, MO
- Ann Arbor, MI
- Cambridge/Somerville, MA

I also spent a fairly significant chunk of time in India (mostly Delhi, Mumbai) during my PhD, though in 2-4 week chunks.

## üì± Contact

It is easiest to reach me via email at the address listed on my profile. For air quality-related inquiries, you can also reach out to QuantAQ directly at hello@quant-aq.com.

## `code`

I write *a lot* of software. I mostly work in Python and C++ and spend most of my time these days across a number of various areas including front-end, back-end, architecture, devops, and embedded software. In addition to writing code, I spend a good chunk of time designing the electrical and mechanical components that comprise QuantAQ's product line.
